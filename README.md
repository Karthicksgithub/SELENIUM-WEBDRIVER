# SELENIUM-WEBDRIVER
AUTOMATION AND WEB SCRAPPING USING SELENIUM WEBDRIVER IN PYTHON
The purpose of this code is to automate interactions with the "Cookie Clicker" web game. Selenium, a web testing and automation tool, is used to control and manipulate a web browser. In this specific script:

Automated Gameplay: The script automates the process of playing the Cookie Clicker game by continuously clicking the big cookie to generate cookies and automatically buying products when there are enough cookies available.

Element Interaction: Selenium is used to locate and interact with elements on the web page, such as clicking buttons and extracting text values. It employs various Selenium functions, including WebDriverWait for waiting until specific elements are present before interacting with them.

Web Scraping: While the primary purpose is automation, this script also involves some aspects of web scraping, as it retrieves information from the web page, such as the number of cookies and product prices.
